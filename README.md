About
-----
This repository contains Poser Data configuration files for Skyrim SE's [Poser Hotkeys](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22860)/[Plus](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17743) mod. This repository does not aim to be a compilation of every Poser Data file that exists in the wild, but rather a place only for files that authors of posing mods did not create. In other words, I create and maintain these configuration files.

### Supported Posing Mods
Links to the posing mods in the table below can be found on the first line of each corresponding *.json* file. Linking will not be added here as it may break GitHub's policy on NSFW/sexually obscene content.
